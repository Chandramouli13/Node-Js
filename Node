//////////// Node Js ////////////////

> Node is a backend
> Single Threaded , asynchronous , Non blocking I/O - input/output
> Open Source - Anybody can contribute to development.
> npm registry - (node package manager)  - it is the biggest registry.
      registry - All Third party packages are available in this npm registry.

Meanings are :

    > Single Threaded means - 

    > All the requests come on same place.
    It follows the Single-Threaded with Event Loop Model. Node JS Processing model mainly inspired by JavaScript Event-based model with JavaScript callback mechanism. Because of which Node.js can handle more concurrent client requests with ease. The event loop is the heart of the Node.js processing model.
    > Whole Process is happening in a single thread.
    > Each request got assigned to the Event. Assigned on same thread.
    > Whenever request completed we will get the response.
    > The response is referred as Callback.

    > Synchronous means -
    Example : An ATM 

    The person goes inside ATM room
    The rest will be outside in the queue waiting to enter accordingly 
    This is called Synchronous and blocking.
    Synchronous - The event will happen one after another.
    Blocking - If the person inside ATM room takes too long & the persons outside in the  queue will be blocked.
    If blocking happen - all other requests are blocked.
    If someone go out of the queue someone will take their position.


    > Asynchronous means -
    Example : Dominos

    The person came into the Dominos and ordered the Pizza
    They will say that you have token number and the token number will be displayed on the screen.

    And another person came and ordered ColdDrink (CocoCola)  
    The coke is ready and they will give it to him.
    They won't wait for the previous person Pizza to ready and after they give to coke person.
    In mean while the Pizza is processing happening behind the scene.
    And the cold_drink is already available and another person will get quickly.
    This is called Asynchronous and Non blocking.
    Asynchronous - Multiple requests are getting processed parallelly
                   without blocking other requests.


According to this scenarios which method is best to handle customers ?
> Obviously Dominos method is better than ATM.
> So Python and Java is like ATM. and NodejS is like Dominos method.


//////// This is why Node is preferred more than other languages in backend. ///////////



First file for JavaScript framework :
///////////////  Package.json ///////////////
> This is the entry point to applications.
> It contains the metaData (name,version,description)
> All the packages we are using in app
> Script (start, build, test)

How to generate this file :
/// step to create package.json
** NodejS must be installed in laptop
> go inside the folder (we created application folder in (NodeJs Edureka - inside learnPackage)) using gitbash/cmd.
> npm init

> Answer all questions

> Type "yes" finally

>>>>>>> package.json is created as you can see in the folder.
we can change anything in this package.json.  

>>>>>>> along with the package.json - package-lock.json is created if you check inside there are dependencies and that is called dependency tree. No need to change anything.

//// step to install package
> go inside the folder (we created application folder(NodeJs Edureka - inside learnPackage)) using gitbash/cmd.

> npm i packageName /(or) npm install packageName. lets say example (npm i cors)

>>>>>>> node_modules folder is created inside cors folder is created and other folders inside are also created (object-assign & vary) those are child dependencies. because this package is made by someone.

>>>>>>> we never transport node_modules folder as it is very heavy folder contains more content and to ignore this when we push the code we use - .gitignore file inside learnPackage folder - inside this file we type node_modules. This will be ignored when we push the code.

>>>>>>> Readme.md (md - markdown) file create inside learnPackage folder for detail description.
